#!/bin/sh
# build-all.sh - build the MSX Turbo-R FDD driver ROMs against every Nextor
# kernel base-file variant found in a directory, plus the RAM driver (which
# needs no kernel base), with the local toolchain (N80,
# mknexrom, make and the SDK submodule; see README). To do the same with no
# local toolchain, use `docker-build.sh --variant all`, which runs this script
# inside the Nextor dev Docker image.
#
# Usage:
#   NEXTOR_KERNEL_BASE_DIR=<dir> ./build-all.sh [make args...]
#
#   NEXTOR_KERNEL_BASE_DIR=~/Nextor/bin/kernel-base ./build-all.sh
#   NEXTOR_KERNEL_BASE_DIR=~/Nextor/bin/kernel-base ./build-all.sh clean-bin all
#   NEXTOR_KERNEL_BASE_DIR=/opt/nextor/kernel_base ./build-all.sh   # in the image
#
# NEXTOR_KERNEL_BASE_DIR (mandatory) is the directory holding the kernel base
# files. No list of variants is needed: the directory is scanned, and every
# .dat file there named by one of the two conventions the Makefile understands
# is a variant to build against:
#
#   Nextor-<ver>.base[<suffix>].dat    as built by the Nextor repository
#   kernel_base[<suffix>].dat          as shipped in the Nextor dev image
#
# <suffix> is empty for the default base and e.g. .NO_UNDOC, .SHIFT_INV,
# .NO_UNDOC.CTRL_INV.KANJI_INV otherwise; it ends up in the ROM names, and for
# the *NO_UNDOC* bases makes the Makefile assemble the driver undoc-free to
# match, exactly as with a plain `make`.
#
# If the directory holds base files for more than one kernel version (e.g.
# leftovers from an earlier build), the ones for the version the SDK reports
# (NEXTOR_SDK/nextor-kernel-version.txt, which is the version the ROMs are
# named after) are used; if none match, the script stops and asks you to sort
# it out rather than guessing.
#
# After the ROMs, the RAM driver (`make ram`, bin/turbofdd.drv) is built -
# but only when no make arguments besides the cleanup goals are given: other
# arguments usually name specific targets that the per-variant loop has
# already run. There is no undoc-free form of the RAM driver - it would be
# byte-identical to the regular one (see the Makefile).
#
# Any arguments are passed through to make (targets, variable overrides), on
# top of the NEXTOR_BASE set for each variant - except that the cleanup goals
# (clean, clean-bin, distclean) run once, up front, rather than once per
# variant: run per variant, each later clean-bin would delete the ROMs just
# built for the previous variants. The NEXTOR_SDK, N80, MKNEXROM and MAKE
# environment variables are honoured. NEXTOR_BASE and NEXTOR_SDK assignments
# (in any make assignment spelling) are rejected as arguments: the former is
# chosen per variant by this script, and the latter must come as an
# environment variable so that the variant selection (see below) uses it too.
# Make options (-n, -f, ...) are rejected as well: only goals and variable
# overrides pass through.

# The pass-through args reach make after this script's own per-variant
# NEXTOR_BASE assignment, and in make the last command-line assignment wins
# (in any of its spellings: =, :=, ::=, :::=, +=, ?=, !=, with or without
# whitespace around the operator): a forwarded NEXTOR_BASE would silently
# override the base for every variant, and a forwarded NEXTOR_SDK would
# steer make but not the family selection below. Reject the two variables
# this script manages, in every assignment spelling. Make options are
# rejected too: this wrapper only understands goals and variable overrides,
# and classifying anything fancier would mean parsing make's option grammar
# here (e.g. in a dry-run `-n clean`, the clean would be hoisted below away
# from the -n and actually delete files). The cleanup goals are pulled out
# of the list at the same time, to be run once before the loop: forwarded
# to every variant, each later `make clean-bin ...` would delete the ROMs
# just built for the previous variants. (The `for` list is expanded once,
# before the first iteration, so rebuilding the positional parameters with
# `set --` inside the loop is safe.)
